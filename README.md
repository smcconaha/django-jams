# Django Jams

This project leverages a Python/Django/Django REST Framework API app to create models that can be migrated into a database to serve as the backend for an application like Spotify or Apple Music.

The app is capable of performing CRUD operations on multiple models (Song, Album, Artist, etc) and includes routes to display information as JSON.
